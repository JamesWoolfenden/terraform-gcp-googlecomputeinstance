Terraform module to provision a secure terraform state bucket for team use of IAC.

---

It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).

## Usage

```hcl
module "compute" {
source      = "JamesWoolfenden/-googlecomputeinstance/gcp"
version     = "0.0.4"
common_tags = var.common_tags
}
```

## Getting started with Terraform and Google Cloud

```cli
Terraform init
Terraform plan
```

This should fail as you dont have anything Google cloud set.

```cli
* provider.google: google: could not find default credentials. See https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/application-default-credentials for more information.
```

This needs for your to set environmental variable
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
This points to a json file.

## Step 1 install the google sdk cli

Windows:

```cli
choco install gcloudsdk
```

Or

Ubuntu:

```bash
# Create environment variable for correct distribution
export CLOUD_SDK_REPO="cloud-sdk-$(lsb_release -c -s)"

# Add the Cloud SDK distribution URI as a package source
echo "deb http://packages.cloud.google.com/apt $CLOUD_SDK_REPO main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-cloud-sdk.list

# Import the Google Cloud Platform public key
curl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -

# Update the package list and install the Cloud SDK
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install google-cloud-sdk
```

## Step 2 Authentication

Once you have the cli installed run:

```cli
gcloud init
```

and that will set up your cli environment.

Create a service account:

```cli
gcloud iam service-accounts create [NAME]
gcloud iam service-accounts create terraform
```

Associate it with your project:

```cli
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] --member "serviceAccount:[NAME]@[PROJECT_ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com" --role "roles/owner"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding focused-elysium-224508 --member "serviceAccount:terraform@focused-elysium-224508.iam.gserviceaccount.com" --role "roles/owner"
```

Now we can obtain our credentials file:
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create [FILE_NAME].json --iam-account [NAME]@[PROJECT_ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com

```cli
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create terraform.json --iam-account terraform@focused-elysium-224508.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

I copied the json file to ~/.gcp and then run (or add to your .bashrc):
Ubuntu

```cli
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/home/[username]/.gcp/terraform.json"
```

or Windows

```cli
$env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="c:\Users\[username]]\.gcp\terraform.json"
```

## Cooking with GAS

Once that var is in your shell you can terraform plan:

```cli
An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  + google_compute_instance.vm_instance
      id:                                                  <computed>
